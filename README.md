# Enigma

## Encrypting a message

The general format is to enter in the command line
`$ ruby encrypt.rb <message_filepath>.txt <output_filepath>.txt <key> <date>`
The key is a 5-digit number and the date is in the format DDMMYY. Both key and date are optional parameters - if you don't enter either, a random key will be generated and today's date will be used.

## Decrypting a message
The general format is to enter in the command line
`$ ruby decrypt.rb <encrypted_message>.txt <output_filepath>.txt <key> <date>`
